Image Classification ResNet18 

This project focusing on learning and implementing machine learning model by create and train model using resnet18 with inferencing to input image and get result


Preparation

	1. Ensure that you have prepare train, validate and test folder for machine learning model
	
					
	
	2. Setting correct path for train, validate and test
	
	
	
	3. Run train_resnet18.py to get model that you have been trained
	
					
	
	4. Ensure that you have folder predict and result 
	
					
	
	5. Put the image you want in the folder predict and run inference.py
